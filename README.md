This project is a simple number guessing game developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. 
The game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range, providing hints like "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed. 
Itâ€™s an interactive and beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of basic Python concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, user input, 
and random number generation. Designed for learning and practice, the Jupyter Notebook format makes it easy to follow the code and understand the logic step-by-step. 
To run the game, simply open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, execute the cells, and play directly in the notebook interface. This is not a standalone application 
but a fun, text-based program intended to help beginners get comfortable with Python programming
